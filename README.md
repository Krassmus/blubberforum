# Blubberforum

A veeery small forum for Stud.IP, which is kinda more facebooky. 
You don't need any reloading of the forum-page to see new entries. 
They just appear infront of you - even while you're typing. 
It is a forum, but feels like a chat. And it is 100% compatible with the standard-forum of Stud.IP.

## Features

* Instant posting-pulling. No page-reload needed to get new postings.
* Everything ajax.
* Formatted postings just like the old forum.
* Drag & Drop fileupload into the textareas. Files will be stored in the filesystem of the course.
* Compatibilit with the old forum. You can switch to old forum or back to blubber-forum at any time.
* Old postings will get back on top of discussion, when a new comment is posted.
* Re-editing of your postings - to fix typos. Your changes will appear directly to the screens of the other users.
* When you edit a posting to a string with zero length, the posting will be deleted.
