blubberforum
============

A veeery small forum for Stud.IP, which is kinda more facebooky. You don't need any reloading of the forum-page to see new entries. They just appear infront of you - even while you're typing. It is a forum, but feels like a chat. And it is 100% compatible with the standard-forum of Stud.IP.
